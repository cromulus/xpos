"""Create the indexes the POS hot paths depend on.

Supersedes `add_composite_indexes` and `add_item_fulltext_index`. Those two
wrapped every statement in a blanket `except: log_error`, so when their DDL
failed they still reported success and were recorded in the Patch Log -- which
means they never run again and their indexes stay missing forever. This patch
is idempotent and lets real failures surface, so it can safely be re-run.
